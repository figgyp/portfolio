      # GitHub Pages doesn't support SPA routing by default.
      # If a user refreshes a non-root route like `/portfolio/testimonial-card`,
      # GitHub Pages returns a 404 unless a `404.html` exists.
      # Copying `index.html` to `404.html` allows the SPA to handle routing
      # client-side, even after a refresh or deep link.
